                <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <br><br>
                üåü Passionate about creating seamless and engaging user experiences, I am <b>Kartik Singh</b>, a Computer Science undergrad from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida.
                <br><br>
                I completed an internship at <b>Shriram Pistons and Rings Ltd.</b> as a Frontend Developer Intern. During this internship, I created a Netflix clone that closely mirrors the original platform‚Äôs interface and user experience. This project honed my skills in <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js</b>, enabling me to build visually compelling and responsive designs.
                <br><br>
                üí° In one novel project, I contributed to healthcare advancements by developing a <b>tuberculosis detection system</b> using a U-Net deep learning model. Recognizing Mycobacterium bacilli from microscopic images wasn‚Äôt just technically challenging; it was a deeply rewarding experience that showcased the intersection of technology and healthcare.
                <br><br>
                üöú I also created the <b>Farmer Buddy App</b>, aimed at promoting sustainable farming with real-time soil analysis to recommend crops. Utilizing Android Studio, Kotlin, Firebase, and integrating sensors with Arduino, this project represents how tech can empower farmers and improve agricultural outputs.
                <br><br>
                üå¶Ô∏è Another endeavor was my <b>Weather App</b> built with React, which offers dynamic weather forecasting. It's designed to provide users with accurate weather updates through an intuitive interface, integrating APIs for precise data processing.
                <br><br>
                üçΩÔ∏è My experience extends to full-stack development with a <b>restaurant application</b> using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. This project involved seamlessly managing data using CRUD operations and ensuring user interaction through secure RESTful APIs.
                <br><br>
                üîß My toolbox includes <b>Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python, C/C++, and SQL</b>. Proficient in <b>Git, VS Code</b>, and libraries like <b>pandas and NumPy</b>, I am committed to continuous learning and applying problem-solving skills to real-world challenges.
                <br><br>
                üí¨ Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate on impactful projects. Feel free to reach out or check my latest projects on <b>GitHub</b>!
